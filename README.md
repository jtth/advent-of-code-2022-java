# Jordan's AOC 2022 in Java

This is not code golf or cleverness. For me, this is about writing extensible solutions and
exploring different facets of Java. These aren't good patterns, mostly. They're meant to be as
expansive and malleable so I can adapt if the parameters of the second question change
significantly. Sometimes I overdo it. Sometimes things are way too entangled. But it's fun, and most
of all, it's explicit.
